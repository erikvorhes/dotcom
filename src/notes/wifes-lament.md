I speak this poem^["poem" could be translated as 'riddle'] about my miserable self, my own journey.^["journey" could be translated as 'fate'] I can tell about the hardship I endured, while I grew up, recently or long ago: never more hardship than now. Always I suffered the torment of my exile-journey.

First, my lord departed from the people and over the tumult of waves. I grieved (at dusk and dawn) about where my leader of men might be. When I, a friendless wanderer, departed, because of my woeful need, and sought his retinue, his kinsmen --- with secret thoughts --- began to conspire how they might separate the two of us: so we have lived most wretchedly, as far apart as possible in this world --- and it afflicted me with longing. My lord ordered me to take up in a grove-abode; I had few dear people, loyal friends, in this country, and my mind is therefore sad. Then I found a man completely suitable for me --- ill-fated, sad in mind, secretive --- planning murder behind my cheerful demeanor. Often we two vowed that nothing at all might separate us except death alone. But now our friendship is changed: it is as if it never had been. Everywhere I must endure the enmity of my beloved.

The man commanded me to dwell in a grove of trees, under an oak tree, in a cave.^["cave" could be translated as 'grave'] This barrow is old; I am completely seized with longing; the valleys are dreary; the hills are lofty; the strongholds are grim, grown over with briars; the house is devoid of joys. Very often the departure of the lord tormented me here. Friends are on earth, living lovers; before dawn they occupy beds, when I alone walk under the oak tree and through the barrows. There I may sit as long as a summer's day; there I can weep over my exile-journeys, my many sorrows; therefore I never can rest from my grieving heart, nor all of the longing that I have begot in in this life.

It could be that a young man must always be sad-minded, hard-hearted; he must likewise have a cheerful demeanor, in addition to heart-grief, a tumult of constant sorrows. If he relies on himself for all his joy in the world, or if he is an outcast,^["an outcast" could be translated as 'stained'] far from the land of his people, that friend of mine --- weary-minded --- sits under a cliff in a frost-covered storm, surrounded by water in a desolate hall, and suffers much grief in his heart; too often he remembers a more delightful house. Woe be to those who must wait the beloved with longing.

## About the Poem

<cite>The Wife's Lament</cite> is notable not only for its powerful language: it is the only poem in Old English that is clearly narrated by a woman.

The poem contains some vocabulary that doesn't translate well into modern English. See the footnotes for a few potential alternate definitions. I've attempted to smooth things out as well as I can; the Old English edition is from Mitchell & Robinson.
