Hello!

It has been almost a decade since I've written anything much longer than a Tweet, and I've been putting it off and putting it off, with all kinds of excuses like wanting to design something I'm proud of or waiting to figure out [something far too clever for its own good](https://drasty.com/), and then shame at not actually finishing anything that constitutes a personal project, and then really loving the work I've been doing at [Transform](https://transform.co) for the past year-and-a-half.

Now is another time for transition, and there's rarely a better time to get back into a habit than when one needs to establish a new routine. [Today is my first real day at dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/), and it's my first day writing.

I've ported a bunch of stuff that might have been worth saving, for whatever reason, and as I find time to dig through the Wayback Machine, I may add more. But the focus is going to be on creating new things rather than recovering whatever I've misplaced.
