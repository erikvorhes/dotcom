Behold a complaint from <cite>Piers Plowman</cite>, a fantastic poem from the Fourteenth Century (B Text; XV.372--376):

::: verse {lang="enm"}
    Gramer, the grounde of al, bigyleth now children
    For is none of this newe clerkes, whoso nymeth hede,
    That can versifye faire ne formalich enditen,
    Ne nought on amonge an hundreth that an auctour can construe,
    Ne rede a lettre in any langage but in Latyn or in Englissh.
:::

Roughly translated:

> Grammar, the foundation of everything, now confuses children: for none of these new clerks, if you observe, can versify fairly or formally compose; not one of a hundred can understand an author or read a letter in any language except Latin or English.

This sounds familiar. I wonder where I've heard it before ...
