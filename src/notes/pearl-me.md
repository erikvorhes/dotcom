Marie Borroff's translation of Pearl is useful enough for our purposes; but if you're curious about the "original" language, see the first 12 lines:

::: verse {lang="enm"}
    Perle plesaunte, to prynces paye
    To clanly clos in golde so clere:
    Oute of oryent, I hardyly saye,
    Ne proued I neuer her precious pere.
    So rounde, so reken in vche araye,
    So smal, so smoþe her sydez were;
    Queresoeuer I jugged gemmez gaye
    I sette hyr sengeley in synglure.
    Allas! I leste hyr in on erbere;
    Þurȝ gresse to grounde hit from me yot.
    I dewyne, fordolked of luf-daungere
    Of þat pryuy perle withouten spot.
:::

The letter that looks like a weird *3* is the Middle English letter *[yogh] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogh)*, which we no longer use. Here's a translation for you:

> Pleasing pearl, pleasing to princes, so purely set in fair gold: out of the Orient, I dare say, I never found one equal her value. So round, so noble in any setting, so small, so smooth her sides were; wherever I judged bright gems I set her apart singularly. Alas! I lost her in a garden; it ran from me, through the grass, to the ground. Languishing, I was grievously wounded from the love-loss of that special pearl without a spot. (1-12)

Later the poet describes the reaction to "her" appearance:

::: verse {lang="enm"}
    The More I frayste hyr fayre face,
    Her fygure fyn quen I had fonte,
    Suche gladande glory con to me glace
    As lyttel byfore þerto watz wonte.
    To calle hyr lyste con me enchace,
    Bot baysment gef myn hert a brunt.
    I seȝ hyr in so strange a place ---
    Such a burre myȝt make myn herte blunt.
:::

> The more I sought her fair face, when I had perceived her fine form, such rejoicing glory began to glide to me as little before then was accustomed. Desire to call her began to provoke me, but confusion gave my heart a shock. I saw her in so strange a place --- such a shock could stop my heart. (169-76)

While Borroff's translation is good, nothing is quite as good as the original. For example, line 41 refers to the "garden" where the pearl is buried as a *huyle*{lang="enm"}, which connotes both a grouping of plants and a grave mound. If you read Borroff's introduction, you'll note that the poem is packed with vicious word-play, especially surrounding the theme of death.

The richness of the original is even clearer in line 905: "<span lang="enm">I am bot mokke and mul among</span>" 'I am only muck mixed with dust.' Borroff translates this as "I am of mire and mere mankind," which is perfectly serviceable, but isn't as stark when the dreamer then describes the pearl-maiden as a rose forever blooming. (The dreamer expresses, among other things, his own insufficiency since the pearl/rose *didn't* flourish under his care.)

This handout only gives you a taste of this difficult Middle English dialect, which John Bowers and others believe to originate near [Cheshire] (https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=cheshire,+england&sll=41.911751,-88.306688&sspn=0.00784,0.016072&ie=UTF8&ll=53.166534,-2.515869&spn=1.616894,4.11438&z=8&om=1).
