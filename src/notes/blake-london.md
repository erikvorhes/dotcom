This is a version of the text of "London" published as a part of <cite>Songs of Innocence and Experience</cite> in 1789 and 1794:

::: verse
## London

    I wander thro' each charter'd street,
    Near where the charter'd Thames does flow
    And mark in every face I meet
    Marks of weakness, marks of woe.

    In every cry of every Man.
    In every Infants cry of fear.
    In every voice; in every ban.
    The mind-forg'd manacles I hear

    How the Chimney-sweepers cry
    Every blacknng Church appalls.
    And the hapless Soldiers sigh
    Runs in blood down Palace walls

    But most thro' midnight streets I hear
    How the youthful Harlots curse
    Blasts the new born Infants tear
    And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse
