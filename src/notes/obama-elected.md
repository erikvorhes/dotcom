::: verse
    It is a strange thing:
    to wake up and see the sun rise,
    to know that its molten metal ascends over the lake,
    to know the sun could care less
    about what happened here while it was away.
    The city rumbles on as if it were any ordinary day,
    but the city has changed:
    on its streets I see tired faces,
    a metropolis of worn out colors.
    This morning is different.
    The people shine in their weariness and say to the sun:

    "We are awake.
    An obscure man from around here
    has stolen our hearts ---
    and we are overjoyed."
