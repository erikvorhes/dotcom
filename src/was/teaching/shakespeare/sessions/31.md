### Reading

* <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (concluded)
* Sonnets 91--93

### Notes

We'll spend about half of this class wrapping up <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>. Come with topics or issues that you'd like to discuss. Then we'll move on to Sonnets 91--93. Recall our previous classes on the sonnets. (A response paper on one or more of these sonnets can enhance your response paper grade.)

A note to the people in the King Lear performance groups: The date has changed to April 10. I have sent a message to each group to get the ball rolling. Have fun!
