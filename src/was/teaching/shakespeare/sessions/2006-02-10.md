### Reading

* <cite>Richard III</cite>: Act 2

### Notes

We'll continue our discussion of Richard III. How do Richard's mechanations progress in the second act? Think also about his use of language --- in his wordplay, is he more or less effective than Iago?

Dahlia Lithwick, who writes the "Jurisprudence" column at [<cite>Slate</cite>](https://slate.com/), has [a great line today about the Zacarias Moussaoui trial](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2006/02/death-charge.html):

> When the crazy folks are the only ones speaking the truth, you're either in a Shakespeare tragedy or Wonderland.

We haven't heard much from the "crazy folks" yet --- but just wait. *They're coming.*
