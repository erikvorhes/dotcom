### Reading

* <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>: Acts 1--2

### Notes

We begin <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>. Please prepare acts 1 and 2 for class. As you read, recall how Iago and Richard use politics and rhetoric to manipulate others for their own ends. Their techniques will operate in contrast to Titus' work; indeed, we could think of <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> as a play that tells the other side of such "manipulation plays" as <cite>Othello</cite> and <cite>Richard III</cite>.

In some ways, <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> will pose a challenge for us. The play is set during the Roman Empire --- and therefore may be considered with <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite>, <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>, and <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, for example. At the same time, however, <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> is more a revenge tragedy than anything else. It is a brutal nightmare of a play, as we'll certainly see. Figuring out what to make of it will be more than half the fun.

Over the weekend I'll be posting the quotation sheet for <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>, as well as instructions for the upcoming essay assignment. I'll be bringing paper copies of the essay assignment to class on Monday.
