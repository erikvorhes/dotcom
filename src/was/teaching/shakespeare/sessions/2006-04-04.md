### <cite>Titus</cite> film viewing

**7:00 -- 10:00 p.m.**, in the classroom.

(If this time doesn't work for you, don't fret: <cite>Titus</cite> should be readily available from most online and brick-and-mortar rental establishments.)

Here is your enticement for coming: **You are welcome to turn in a one-page review of the film** in light of your having read Shakespeare's <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>. This review is one point of extra credit, which will be added to your final grade. (Thus, Bill Shakespeare could end up with 101/100, since he's such a great student!) *The review is due on April 12, in class.*
