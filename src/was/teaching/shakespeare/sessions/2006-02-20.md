### Reading

* <cite>Macbeth</cite>: Acts 2--4
* Andrew Gurr, "The Shakespearean Stage" (3281--3301)

### Notes

We'll continue our discussion of <cite>Macbeth</cite>. It will probably be most beneficial for us to think about this play from three angles:

1. the role of Lady Macbeth and the treatment of women,
2. the nature of treachery, and
3. the function of the supernatural.

Specifically, what are Macbeth's and Lady Macbeth's attitudes toward murder? What do you make of the scenes with Banquo's ghost? What do you think of Macduff's behavior, especially when he "abandons" his wife? How do the scenes with the *wyrd*{lang="ase"} sisters fit in to the play?

At the same time, we should think of this play in terms of its being *drama*. Note that Macbeth is filled with spectacle and is staged on multiple levels. How do you suppose an audience would react to this play? Gurr's essay should be especially helpful in conceptualizing <cite>Macbeth</cite> as theater.
