### Reading

* Sonnets 12, 64, and 81

### Notes

For sonnet 81, notice that the <cite>Norton Shakespeare</cite> gives us different punctuation than the 1609 version gives us. What interpretive possibilities change when punctuation changes?

Also for sonnet 81, regarding the relationship between *hearse* and *rehearse*: the word *hearse* predates Shakespeare and was in use during his time. Think of it as a synonym for *bier*. There's also a verbal form that means "to lay (a corpse) on a bier in a coffin; to bury with funeral rites and ceremonies."

For a more recent take on the sonnet form, check out "The Rural Carrier Stops to Kill a Nine-Foot Cottonmouth," by T. R. Hummer:

::: verse
    Lord God, I saw the son-of-a-bitch uncoil
    In the road ahead of me, uncoil and squirm
    For the ditch, squirm a hell of a long time.
    Missed him with the car. When I got back to him, he was all
    But gone, nothing left on the road but the tip-end
    Of his tail, and that disappearing into Johnson grass.
    I leaned over the ditch and saw him, balled up now, hiss.
    I aimed for the mouth and shot him. And shot him again.

    Then I got a good strong stick and dragged him out.
    He was long and evil, thick as the top of my arm.
    There are things in this world a man can't look at without
    Wanting to kill. Don't ask me why. I was calm
    Enough, I thought. But I felt my spine
    Squirm, suddenly. I admit it. It was mine.
