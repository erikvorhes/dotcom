### Reading

* <cite>The Winter's Tale</cite> (2883--2952)
* "Town and Country: Life in Shakespeare's England" (BC, 219--36)

### Notes

We'll begin class by following up on Wednesday's crash course on textual criticism.

Then we'll move on to today's reading. We'll talk about how a "Romance" is different generically from either comedy or tragedy. Consider also how the city/country dynamic in this play compares to what we saw in <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>.
