### Notes

Wednesday's class discussion was excellent. Thanks for contributing!

We'll conclude our discussion of <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>. In preparation for the quiz, you'll want to review the quotation handout (print only; if you don't have it, please contact me).

Today's discussion will start with Oberon. Why does he choose to manipulate Titania? What does their "relationship" (and Titania's with Bottom) tell us?

Finally, we should note Robin Goodfellow's epilogue and extrapolate what it means to be "in the audience":

::: verse
    If we shadows have offended,
    Think but this, and all is mended:
    That you have but slumbered here,
    While these visions did appear;
    And this weak and idle theme,
    No more yielding but a dream,
    Gentles, do not reprehend.
    If you pardon, we will mend.
    And as I am an honest puck,
    If we have unearnèd luck
    Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,
    We will make amends ere long,
    Else the puck a liar call.
    So, good night unto you all.
    Give me your hands, if we be friends
    And Robin shall restore amends.
