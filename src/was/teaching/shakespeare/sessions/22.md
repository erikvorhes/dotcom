### Reading

* <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite> (814--60): Acts 1--3
* "'I Loved My Books': Shakespeare's Reading" (BC, 145--62)

### Notes

I hope you've had a refreshing spring break!

Today we'll begin <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>. Think especially about the relationship between the city and the country in the play. It would also be beneficial to compare the various relationships in the play to others that we have already seen.

Some of Shakespeare's inspiration for this play comes from Greco-Roman mythology. Remember to read the Bedford Companion essay on "Shakespeare's Reading"; it should help put some of his use of sources into a clearer context.
