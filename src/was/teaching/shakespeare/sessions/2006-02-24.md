### Reading

* <cite>Macbeth</cite> (concluded)

### Notes

Today we wrap up <cite>Macbeth</cite>, with our second dramatic performance and a discussion that will focus on Lady Macbeth. For the latter, think especially about her relationship to the ideas of madness and masculinity. Consider, also, how she can be connected to the other women in the play --- especially Lady Macduff, Hecate, and the witches (who, to quote Emily Dickinson, "Tell all the Truth but tell it slant").

### Housekeeping

If you are going to fall short of the required five response papers, or if you are dissatisfied with one of your response grades, fear not. You can write a response to one of the assigned sonnets, due on the day we're scheduled to discuss it. I will average this grade with your lowest response grade; in the unlikely event that the average grade is *lower* than your original grade, the higher grade will stand.
