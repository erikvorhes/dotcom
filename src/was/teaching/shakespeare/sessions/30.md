### Reading

* <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>: Act 5

### Notes

Please have act 5 of Titus Andronicus prepared for today. Near the end of Wednesday's class, we stumbled onto the idea of these characters functioning as if they were automatons: that is, they seem to be virtually unchanging stereotypes whom Shakespeare merely winds up and sets on the stage.

This is, of course, an oversimplification. But how do these relatively flat figures come together to make such a compelling play? Is it that we're attracted to the violence? Do we somehow feel "trapped" in our own lives --- unable to control events around us or unable to remain balanced on increasingly treacherous terrain --- and therefore (forgive the clich√©) "identify" with these characters? Or is there something even more fundamental going on here?

We'll begin with the scheduled **dramatic performance** and then delve into the above questions and whatever else interests you about the play. For example, we actually have a *mother* in the play; what does Tamora have to say about motherhood?

And finally, we'll return to the issues that drive this tragedy: obedience and revenge.
