### Reading

* <cite>Othello</cite> (concluded)
* Thomas Rymer, "From <cite>A Short View of Tragedy</cite>" (BC, 108)

### Notes

We'll continue our discussion about assumptions, deception, and stereotypes in <cite>Othello</cite>. We should be especially careful to address the ways that the play employs gender relations. (For example: What are Iago's attitudes toward women --- especially toward Emilia? How do Emilia and Desdemona participate in the play's action?) In addition, it will be useful to consider gender in light of Fridayâ€™s discussion of racial attitudes.

Make sure to bring your own questions and concerns to class. What aspects of <cite>Othello</cite> do you think are important but remain unaddressed?
