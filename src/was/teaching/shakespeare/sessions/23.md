### Reading

* <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>: Acts 1--3 (continued)
* Ovid, "From <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>," <abbr title="translated by">trans.</abbr> Arthur Golding (BC, 190--192)

### Notes

We'll pay close attention to the following questions:

1. How do the city and the forest function differently? Are there ways in which they're similar?
2. How does magic work? Is it harmless or dangerous or both? (Think especially, but not only, of Robin Goodfellow, a.k.a. "Puck.")
3. How does the play model relationships between men and women, between laborers and gentry?

I encourage you to come to class with your own questions and concerns, as well.
