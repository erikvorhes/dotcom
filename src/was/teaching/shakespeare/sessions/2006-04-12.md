### Reading

* **Compare** <cite>The Tragedy of King Lear</cite> with <cite>The History of King Lear</cite>
* "What Is Your Text?" (BC, 194--210)

For class today, we will be talking about the textual problem of <cite>King Lear</cite>, document some differences between the "History" and the "Tragedy," and (perhaps!) also speculate about the reasons for some of those changes. I will most likely be calling on some of you to tell me what you found, so please come prepared.

(Speaking of coming to class prepared, **there will be a quiz today**.)

If the discussion of textual criticism intrigued you, you might want to [read my note on the text](/notes/lear-problems).
