### Reading

* <cite>Macbeth</cite>: Act 5

### Notes

We'll continue our discussion of <cite>Macbeth</cite>. We should be especially concerned with the portrayal of blood in the play. For instance, think of the times when blood is specifically mentioned and how those references influence what else happens in those scenes.

Also consider the play's portrayal of violence and the supernatural. How are they connected? Who, other than Macbeth, "sees things"? How do these visions add to the play's discussion of treachery?
