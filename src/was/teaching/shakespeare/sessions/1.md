Introductions: we will review the syllabus and course website; we will discuss our prior experience with Shakespeare and make our first foray into early modern English pronunciation, syntax, and vocabulary.

### Notes

This is from the "Queen Mab" dialogue between Romeo and Mercutio; [David Crystal](https://www.shakespeareswords.com) reads lines 1.4.50--76 from the Penguin edition:

Romeo
  ~ I dreamt a dream tonight.

Mercutio
  ~ And so did I.

Romeo
  ~ Well, what was yours?

Mercutio
  ~ That dreamers often lie.

Romeo
  ~ In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

Mercutio
  ~ O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
  ~ She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
  ~ In shape no bigger than an agate stone
  ~ On the forefinger of an alderman,
  ~ Drawn with a team of little atomies
  ~ Over men's noses as they lie asleep.
  ~ Her chariot is an empty hazelnut
  ~ Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
  ~ Time out o'mind the fairies' coachmakers.
  ~ Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs;
  ~ The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
  ~ Her traces, of the smallest spider web;
  ~ Her collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
  ~ Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
  ~ Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
  ~ Not half so big as a round little worm
  ~ Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.
  ~ And in this state she gallops night by night
  ~ Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
  ~ O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
  ~ O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
  ~ O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
  ~ Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
  ~ Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
