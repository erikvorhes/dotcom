### Reading

* <cite>The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice</cite> (2100--2172): Acts 1--3
* "Tragedy" (BC, 85--90)
* Giovanni Battista Girardi Cinthio, "From <cite lang="it">Gli Hecatommithi</cite>" (BC, 169--170)

### Notes

For today we should think especially about what *tragedy* is. What are the conventions of the genre? How are tragedy and comedy related; in what ways do they operate differently?

Note that <cite>Othello</cite> has overt similarities to <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>. Part of this, of course, is the mutual theme of deception, which is developed in <cite>Othello</cite> not only by playing off of trust issues, but also various stereotypes and expectations.

Also, bring your schedules with you to class: we should schedule a time to view <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite> before our discussion has become too temporally distant.
