**No class**: work on your papers and prepare for the exam!

### Exam preparation notes

Bring to the exam the following items:

* 2 writing implements of your choice
* **your essay**: both the final draft and my graded rough draft
* drinking water, as you won't be allowed to leave the exam until you're done
* your thinking caps (I had to throw in one clich√©!)

*Please don't bring anything else to the exam.*

In order to prepare for the exam, you'll want to review your class notes, the reading assignments, this class site, and the midterm exam. You should review the plays' quotation handouts: you will be responsible for these quotes. In addition, I expect you to have a general understanding of each of the plays and the assigned reading from <cite>The Bedford Companion</cite> --- and to be familiar with the following terms:

* *concordia discors*{lang="la"}
* *sprezzatura*{lang="it"}
* Machiavel / Machiavellian
* iambic pentameter
* blank verse
* tragedy
* comedy
* quarto
* folio
* *agon* (also: protagonist, antagonist)
* Shakespearean & Petrarchan sonnet
* quatrain
* octave
* sestet
* holograph
* fortune's wheel

The exam will run approximately 90 minutes (if you're well-prepared) and will consist of passage identification and explication; short-answer questions (on the above terms and other "general knowledge"); and two 3-4 page essays (from a choice of three essay questions).

If you have any questions about the exam, do not hesitate to contact me.
