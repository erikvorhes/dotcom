### McElroy Shakespeare Celebration

**7:30 p.m.**, in the Mullady Theater.

Please make every attempt to attend the McElroy Shakespeare Celebration. (I'm sure it will be more entertaining and edifying than the Guster concert, right?)

*If you come*, I will offer a deal similar to what I did for <cite>Titus</cite>. Write a one-page response to the lecture and performance, turn it in to me by Friday, April 21, and I will add up to one point of extra credit to your final grade. (What a deal!)
