### Reading

* Sonnets 121, 130, and 132

### Notes

We've talked briefly about rhyme and meter (especially iambic pentameter) in class. When you read the sonnets, pay special attention to both of these poetic aspects.

Thanks to Lorraine Eadie for her work today, especially on the various sonnet forms!
