### Reading

* <cite>King Lear</cite>: Act 5
* Nahum Tate, "From <cite>The History of King Lear</cite>" (BC 383--385)
* "The Church" and "The Ideology of Order" (BC, 315--321)

### Notes

We continue our discussion of <cite>King Lear</cite>, now through act 5; we'll start with **two performances**.

Our discussion should focus not only on those performances, but also on the concerns about disability that the play raises: think especially of blindness and madness. Make sure to bring your own concerns to class as well.
