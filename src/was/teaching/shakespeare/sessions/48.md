**Dénouement**{lang="fr"}

Thanks for an excellent semester of "Introduction to Shakespeare." I hope you've developed a greater appreciation of one of the most influential authors in English --- and perhaps considered how literature can play a role in your other interests. (I should probably give you some line about how I hope you've further developed your critical thinking skills, but that should be the goal of *any* class.)

By now your grades should have posted. As points of reference for you, here are some average grades for the class:

* Essay (draft / final): C+ / B
* Final exam: C+
* Overall grade: B-

Your final papers, final exams, and any other outstanding materials are available in the English Department and will remain available until noon on Tuesday, 23 May. This stuff will be placed on the ledge above my mail box; each of you should find a file folder with your name on it.

If you're curious about the significance of the exam numbers, check out these links: [1066](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings), 1214 (I meant [1215](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council)), and 1380 (I meant [1381](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants_Revolt)). I need to get my dates right!

Thanks again for a great semester. Have an invigorating summer!
