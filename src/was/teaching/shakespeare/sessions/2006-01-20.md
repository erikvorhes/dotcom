### Notes

Think about the ways that comedy, as a genre, functions. In what ways does <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite> follow comedic conventions, and in what ways does it deviate from them? What might be the effect of those similarities and differences on our reception of the play?

The plot of <cite>Much Ado</cite> is heavily predicated on deception. Consider the different ways that Shakespeare employs deception and its motivation in the opening three acts. (Note well that deception works best when the deceiver plays off the tendencies of his or her mark!)

There have been a few questions about response papers. You're expected to write on five of the eight plays we cover. If you want to write on <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>, acts 1--3, that paper is due Friday, 20 January.
