### Reading

* <cite>The Winter's Tale</cite> (concluded)

### Notes

On Monday we framed the play's portrayal of the city and the country. Our focus was primarily on the country life --- especially on its idealization, which results in rural characters appearing at once na√Øve and simple. Note especially how the old shepherd and the clown stick out when they're in Sicilia (in act 5).

Today we'll continue thinking about the urban--rural tension, especially as it plays out from the perspectives of Polixenes and Camillo. We also must address the play's portrayal of magic, its bizarre reported good news (in contrast with the more usual "reported death" in tragedy).

Thus far we've introduced some new terminology: the idea of [*agon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agon) and the three Aristotelean unities of time, space, and action, all of which <cite>The Winter's Tale</cite> violates. It is in your interest to familiarize yourself with these ideas --- especially with *agon*.

### Important!

As you complete your essay drafts, remember especially this advice from the assignment sheet: *think small*. The essay topics I've given are intentionally broad, so that you can write about some aspect of those issues that interests you. Be careful, however, not to hang yourself with the long rope I've given you!

In addition, you need to use Shakespeare's writing as your primary source --- that is, your claim should focus on the subject matter of this course; you should use his writing as evidence to support your claim; and you should cite specific examples from the plays or sonnets, paying special attention to his language.

**Make sure to bring two copies of your essay to class.**
