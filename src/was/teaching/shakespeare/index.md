William Shakespeare has remained a cultural and literary force for over 400 years. In this course we will study eight of his plays --- <cite>King Lear</cite>, <cite>Macbeth</cite>, <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>, <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>, <cite>Othello</cite>, <cite>Richard III</cite>, <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>, and <cite>The Winter's Tale</cite> --- and his poetry, in order to develop a greater critical understanding of and familiarity with Shakespeare's writing and its influence.

Of special concern in this course will be his portrayal of community and social relations. We will examine the ways in which outsiders are incorporated into and expelled by society, the use of social standing and rank to advance one's goals, attitudes concerning disability and difference, the function of magic on the mundane, and so on.
