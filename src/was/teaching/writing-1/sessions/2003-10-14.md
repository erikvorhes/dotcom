### Reading

* Mark Twain, "Corn-pone Opinions" (Oates, 1--5)
* John Updike, "The Disposable Rocket" (Oates, 549--552)

### Notes

Remember that you should come to class having written one or two sentences on each question (in addition to the usual response paper); these will be used to jump-start discussion, and you may be asked to share your answers. Without further ado, here are Tuesday's questions:

1. Twain, "Corn-Pone Opinions": What do you think of Twain's view of conformity? Should we evaluate the opinions that we share with a larger community? Can one person possess a belief that no one else has (ignore the logical fallacy of discovering the specific beliefs of every person who ever lived)?
2. Updike, "The Disposable Rocket": What is this essay really about? (If you can get past the "graphic" details, you might be surprised.)

There are, of course, many other questions; feel free to ask some of your own. See you in class!
