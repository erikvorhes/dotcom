**[Essay 2](../syllabus#essay-2) due.**

### Reading

* <cite>Macbeth</cite>, Act 1

### Notes

You should probably do the following while reading <cite>Macbeth</cite>, especially if you want to remain sane:

1. Remember that you are reading a *play*, a text whose action is supposed to be performed in some sort of public space. You will be well served if you attempt to imagine the text being performed in a three-dimensional space, whether that space is a traditional theater or something more like a finished film. Visualize the characters interacting with each other, with the audience, and with their environment.
2. As you read, make sure to check out the glosses & notes at the bottom of each page. Use a dictionary to look up any words that you don't understand.
3. Make a mental note about which character is speaking and if he/she is speaking to one or more characters. (Pronouns in the text should help you figure that last bit out.)
4. Although stage directions are scant, they should also help you figure out what's going on.
5. This is **most important**, in many ways: be sure to re-read the text after you have attempted the above steps. Things should make more sense to you --- and (I hope) the play will therefore become more entertaining & rewarding.

Have fun!

### Office Hours

10:45 -- 1:30, in Cudahy library. (I'll be working on some of my own research, but please feel free to find me. I'll be in the big study room with the high ceiling or meeting with another student by the vending machines.)
