### Reading

* John Dawkins, "Teaching Punctuation as a Rhetorical Tool" (handout)
* Pico Iyer, "In Praise of the Humble Comma" (handout)

### Notes

Consider ways in which you might use Dawkinsâ€™s advice in your own (previous & future) writing.

If you're interested in arcane discussions of grammar, you might be interested in [John Gruber's commentary on this article in the <cite>New York Times</cite>](https://daringfireball.net/2007/09/subpar) (note: the error in the quoted material isn't an "[itso](https://daringfireball.net/2007/08/itso)"). If you're interested in the process of revision --- and you should be! --- you might want to read [his follow-up to some of his readers' comments](https://daringfireball.net/2007/09/scratch_that_its).
