**[Essay 3](../syllabus#essay-3) due.**

### Notes

Thanks for a good semester!

For those of you who weren't in class on Thursday, you have two options for your final paper: revise as usual --- or choose to write a process essay.

#### What is a "process essay"?

Write about three pages on how you would revise your draft. You can discuss research that you would perform, arguments that you would develop, or radical changes that you would make. Write clearly and with purpose; feel free to discuss the process that you use to write papers generally, if you wish. Above all, make sure to critically evaluate your own writing. What are your strengths and weaknesses? What are your paper's gaps? What would you like to have accomplished? In addition, if you feel that your paper had a weak thesis statement, please revise it and include it as the first paragraph of your process essay.
