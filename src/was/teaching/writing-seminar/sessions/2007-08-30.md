### Reading

* Lewis Thomas, "Notes on Punctuation" (handout)

### Notes

For class today, think about the "clever" ways that Thomas teaches about punctuation in his essay. We might play some more (and hopefully better-planned) punctuation games. In addition, we'll talk about why a writing class is a good thing for you to take (aside from it's being necessary for you to graduate, of course).

Today we also will begin an occasional "series" called "New Developments in English Communication." We'll look at [this post from David Pogue's blog](https://archive.nytimes.com/pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/the-next-generation-of-online-shorthand/).
