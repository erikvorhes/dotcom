### Announcement

Bring a copy of [essay 2](../syllabus#essay-2), no matter its current state. We'll be doing some workshopping --- to help you solve any problems you might have with your essay.

### Notes

While the essay's due date has changed to Thursday, November 1, you'll still need to prepare <cite>Macbeth</cite>, act 1. I'll introduce the play today. You might be interested in checking out [early modern English pronunciation](/was/teaching/shakespeare/schedule#2006-01-18). We'll address this in detail either today or at the beginning of the next class.
