### Reading

* Adam Gopnik, "Death of a Fish" (85--95)

### Notes

We'll be talking quite a bit about Gopnik's essay, especially with how it employs structure to its advantage.

If you haven't seen Vertigo, we'll have to do something about that. (Hint: it may involve a schedule change!)

In the meantime, here's [a little grammar & sentence structure exercise](https://thisisindexed.com/2007/08/pick-your-main-verb-carefully/) for your edification or entertainment. ~This other diagram, though, will probably only make your head hurt.~

You might be interested in [a discussion of the exclamation mark](https://slate.com/human-interest/2007/08/on-the-overuse-of-exclamation-points.html).

In addition, I'll be posting my grading standards before class on Thursday. Thanks for your patience!
