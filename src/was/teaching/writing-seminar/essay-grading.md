In addition to the following, you might want to read the grading standards published by the English department.

I have a relatively simple rubric for grading essays. If you write a clear, well-ordered, and on-topic paper, you will do well. If that paper is also thoughtful and exhibits "originality" (see below), you will excel. If your paper is unclear, disorganized, and so on, you probably won't do well.

Remember that good papers come primarily from hard work. If I disagree with your premise, conclusions, or evidence on philosophical/ethical grounds, I will probably let you know --- but my biases along those lines will not affect your grade. On the other hand, if it is unclear to me how you came to those (or any) conclusions, that will negatively impact your grade.

My priorities in grading are as follows:

1. *Cohesion* --- Your essay is focused, well-ordered, logically developed; and I know what you're planning to do when I read your thesis statement (which is some sort of truth-claim). It also helps if your conclusion actually feels like the end of your essay.
2. *Clarity* --- You understand the words your using and they are in appropriate contexts; I don't get confused by your sentence structure; your examples and definitions enhance the cohesion of your paragraphs and the essay as a whole.
3. *Conciseness* --- Your writing is efficient.
4. *Format & documentation* --- You follow the guidelines [in the syllabus](../syllabus).
5. *Mechanics* --- You spell correctly and write in a grammatically correct way. (Note: I tend not to grade down for poor grammar unless I have already informed you of a mistake or if your error actively inhibits the meaning you're trying to convey.)

## A note on originality

Remember **never** to pass off someone else's work as your own! You should also be concerned if you find that your essay follows the argument of someone else's work. That said, if you feel like your topic isn't very original, you should keep writing and attempt to put your stamp on it. The writer of Ecclesiastes (1.9--10) reminds us:

::: verse
    What has been is what will be,
    and what has been done is what will be done;
    there is nothing new under the sun.
    Is there a thing of which it is said,
    "See, this is new"?
    It has already been,
    in the ages before us.
