Writing is thinking. In this course we will develop our ability to clearly and effectively convey our thoughts, ideas, and concerns, by means of the written word. Because writing is as challenging as any other acquired skill, we will concentrate our efforts on various writing assignments (both in and out of class) and on reading and analyzing the work of others. This course should help to demystify the writing process (in academic and other settings) and enable you to become more skillful --- and confident --- writers.

For additional expectations and class policies, consult the [syllabus](./syllabus).

## Required Texts

* Shakespeare, William. <cite>Macbeth: Texts and Contexts</cite>. <abbr title="edited by">Ed.</abbr> William C. Carroll. New York: Bedford, 1999.
* Slater, Lauren, <abbr title="editor">ed.</abbr> <cite>The Best American Essays, 2006</cite>. New York: Houghton, 2006.

The above books will be available at Beck's only. In addition to these texts, you are expected to consult the course web page, which will contain additional reading materials, links to useful online resources, schedule updates, and class notes. The university also expects you to purchase <cite>The Bedford Handbook</cite> (LUC & 7th <abbr title="edition">ed.</abbr>). The Loyola-specific information in that book can be found at the same website as the course [learning outcomes](./syllabus#learning-outcomes). It can be helpful to have this kind of book on hand as you write. If you choose not to purchase <cite>The Bedford Handbook</cite>, I recommend <cite>The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</cite>, 6th <abbr title="edition">ed.</abbr>, which should be available at most bookstores. In addition, you should obtain access to a decent dictionary.
