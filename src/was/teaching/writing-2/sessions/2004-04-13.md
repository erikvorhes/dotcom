Course evaluations!

### Notes

We'll wrap up <cite>The Corrections</cite>, so please bring your copy. This is the last day of class, so we'll be especially philosophical:

* What is <cite>The Corrections</cite> about?
* How is <cite>The Corrections</cite> different from what we've read previously? How is it similar?

Think especially about how writing functions as a *communicative* act:

* To whom does writing communicate?
* What can writing communicate?
* How does writing communicate? (Think especially in terms of *genre*.)
* How can writing influence/affect community?
* What *is* writing?
