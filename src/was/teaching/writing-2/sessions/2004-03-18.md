### Reading

* Franzen, <cite>The Corrections</cite> (3--12)

### Notes

A brief discussion guide:

* Some people have complained about the novel's difficulty. Is this an important/valid concern? Are hard things always more rewarding?
* What do you think of the characters? Are there any you find compelling? What's up with Chip?
* How important do you think location is to the novel?
* Recall our discussion about symbols. What is symbolic in the novel? (Think especially about saints and children's stories.)
