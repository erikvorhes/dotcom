### Reading

* Art Spiegelman, <cite>Maus</cite> (part I, pages 5--93)

### Notes

We'll start with an introduction to reading comics.

* How does this biography engage you differently than the other assigned readings for this class?
* What do you do with the spaces between frames?
* What does the merging of text and image do to the story?
* Assess the main characters (Vladek, Anja, Mala, and Art). What do you think of them? Whom do you find especially compelling?
