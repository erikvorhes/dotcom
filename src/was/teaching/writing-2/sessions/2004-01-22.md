**Response 2 due.**

Leads: Raven G., David S.

### Reading

* Zora Neale Hurston, "How It Feels to Be Colored Me" (Oates 114--119)

### Notes

Leads have been excellent so far --- keep up the good work!

Hurston is an interesting figure from the Harlem Renaissance. You can read Alice Walker's "Looking for Zora" (Oates 395--411) to learn more about her life. Questions:

* What power does Hurston find in identity?
* The tone is radically different in Hurston's and Baldwin's essays. Why do you suppose this is so?

On Tuesday I mentioned two things by Langson Hughes. One is [his review of Baldwin's "Notes of a Native Son"](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-baldwin/notes-native-son/); the other is "Harlem" (1951):

::: verse
    What happens to a dream deferred?
    Does it dry up
    like a raisin in the sun?
    Or fester like a sore ---
    And then run?
    Does it stink like rotten meat?
    Or crust and sugar over ---
    like a syrupy sweet?
    Maybe it just sags
    like a heavy load.
    *Or does it explode?*
