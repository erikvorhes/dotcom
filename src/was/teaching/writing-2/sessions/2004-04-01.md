### Reading

* Franzen, <cite>The Corrections</cite> (339--459)

### Notes

* You've only briefly met Denise up to this point. What do you think of her now?
* Has Chip's stay in Lithuania changed him?
* How does Franzen elaborate on relationships in this section?

I've mentioned family systems theory in class a few times; it's a field primarily related to psychology. One of the field's big names is Harriet Lerner, and some key books by her follow:

* <cite>The Dance of Anger: A Woman's Guide to Changing the Patterns of Intimate Relationships</cite>
* <cite>The Dance of Deception: Pretending and Truth-Telling in Women's Lives</cite>
* <cite>The Dance of Intimacy: A Woman's Guide to Courageous Acts of Change in Key Relationships</cite>

Family systems theory suggests that one of the biggest threats to family/relational stability is the secret. How do secrets play out in <cite>The Corrections</cite>?

(A somewhat unrelated book, but one that may be helpful in figuring out some of the issues in The Corrections is Gregg Easterbrook's <cite>The Progress Paradox</cite>, which is on course reserve.)
