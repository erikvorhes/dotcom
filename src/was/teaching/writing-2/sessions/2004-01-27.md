### Reading

* Richard Rodriguez, "Aria: A Memoir of a Bilingual Childhood" (Oates 447--466)

### Notes

Questions:

* What is the thrust of Rodriguez's argument?
* Does the personal nature of his essay make his argument more or less persuasive?
* Do you agree or disagree with his argument?

I have placed 2 copies of "Death and Texas" (Thursday's assigned reading) on reserve at the library; I hope you will have access to it if you want to read it before Tuesday!

The [requirements for essay 1](../syllabus#essay-1) are available.
