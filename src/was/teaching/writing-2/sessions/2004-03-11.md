**Response 6 due.**

Leads: Matthew N., Jin Chen H.

### Reading

* Joyce Carol Oates, "They All Just Went Away" (Oates 553--563)

### Notes

I've added information about [the second essay](../syllabus#essay-2).

* What is the relationship between the early image-collages and the later narrative surrounding the Weidels?
* Do you think that Oates uses sentence fragments and other "errors" effectively? Why or why not?
* How does Oates's role as a writer play into this essay?
