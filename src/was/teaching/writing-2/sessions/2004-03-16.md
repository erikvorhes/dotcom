**Annotated bibliography due.**

Leads: Kaitlin S., Melissa L.

### Reading

* Franzen, "Meet Me in St. Louis," <cite>How to Be Alone</cite> (286--302; on reserve)

### Notes

* What do you think of Franzen's attitude during this stuff?
* If you watch television "homecoming" documentaries or news "magazines," what does artificiality do to your perception of them? To *Oprah*, et al.?
* Do you believe Franzen's assessment of the situation?
* Do you buy his take on the Oprah's book club fiasco? (E.g., compare it with [this account](https://slate.com/culture/2001/11/what-s-the-beef.html).)
* What role do marketing and community play in this essay? (Is one better than the other? Why or why not? And can we separate them?)
