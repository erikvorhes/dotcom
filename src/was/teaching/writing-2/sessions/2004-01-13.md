### Reading

* David Bartholomae, "Inventing the University" (handout)

### Notes

Discussion questions on Bartholomae (though you should also make sure to identify any unfamiliar vocabulary!):

* What claims about university writing does Bartholomae make? Do you agree or disagree with his assessment?
* Based on your own experience, what kinds of writing are considered "good" at this level?
* You may have heard the terms *high-school writing* and *college writing*: do you think these things are fundamentally different? How?
* Bartholomae addresses more than writing at the university. Extrapolate, if you can, what his essay says about community. (This may prove difficult, but it should be fruitful.)

Remember that if you choose to respond to Bartholomae, your response (1 single-spaced page) is due today. You have two options, either to respond directly to the essay, or to consider what your expections for "good" writing are.

Note: If you feel at all comfortable with your English skills, consider volunteering at the [Loyola Community Literacy Center](https://www.luc.edu/literacy/). Orientation begins January 12 or 13 at 7:00 p.m.
