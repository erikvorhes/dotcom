### Reading

* Franzen, <cite>The Corrections</cite> (139--238)

### Notes

* Remember to keep track of peculiar images, objects, and vocabulary (especially the various forms of correct). Things that at first seem unusual are important, because they will frequently reappear in the narrative --- and often in a different setting. (Remember how effectively this worked for <cite>Maus</cite>.)
* What do you think of Gary and his family?
* How do they relate to Alfred and Enid? (Do they relate to them?)
* How do Gary's life and behavior compare to Chip's?
* How do Gary and ~Charlotte~ ++Caroline++ relate to each other?
* How does Gary relate to his children?
* What is the role of sex in this section? of money? of mental health?
