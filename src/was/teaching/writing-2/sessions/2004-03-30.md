Leads: Gabriella F., Sara S.

### Reading

* Franzen, <cite>The Corrections</cite> (241--338)

### Notes

* What roles do memory and desire play in this section?
* What do you think of Alfred's hallucinations?
* What do you think of the other passengers?
* What role does storytelling play?
* Pay attention, again, to repeated words, ideas, and images. Recall, especially, previous iterations of *lion* and *to correct*.
