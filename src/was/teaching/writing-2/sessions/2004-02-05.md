**Response 4 due.**

Leads: Matthew B., Andrew Z., Jay K.

### Reading

* Stephen Jay Gould, "The Creation Myths of Cooperstown" (Oates 520--531).

### Notes

Discussion questions:

* What role does myth play in the development of community?
* Do you think that Gould is only arguing for a deeper understanding of baseball's origin? Why or why not?
* Try to identify at least one stylistic device that Gould employs to good effect. Also remember to define any vocabulary that is unfamiliar to you.
