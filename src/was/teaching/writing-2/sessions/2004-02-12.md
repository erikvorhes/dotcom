**Library Orientation!** (continued)

### Notes

Lenora Berendt has some useful reminders for us as we research our topics. When you evaluate a source, remember to consider its

* authority,
* objectivity,
* accuracy,
* coverage (completeness), and
* currency (i.e., how current the source is).

When you start research, Pegasus is a good resource. But when you want to check out journals and other articles --- an always good step! --- you should check the library's "resources by subject" page. When in doubt, select the "General" resources; especially useful is Academic Search Elite.

Remember also to take advantage of the library's inter-campus and inter-library loan services: both can save you time, but the latter is especially useful in obtaining materials that Loyola itself doesn't have. You can access this information through the library's online forms page.
