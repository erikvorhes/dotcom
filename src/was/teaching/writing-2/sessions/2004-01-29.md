**Response 3 due.**

Leads: Sara S., David S., Liz B.

### Reading

* Virgina Stem Owens, "Death and Texas" (handout)

### Notes

I have placed two copies of Owens's essay on reserve, in case you misplace the handout. We'll focus our discussion on what the leads have to say, but if you feel intellectually stuck, consider why Owens is concerned about the dynamic in the "community conversation" portion of the installment. Today we'll also look at peer editing for part of class time.

The research proposal (**due Tuesday**) is simply a brief statement about what you want to research for your final paper.
