### Reading

* James Baldwin, "Notes of a Native Son" (Oates 220--38)

### Notes

It might be worth your time, despite the essay's autobiographical nature, to read [a brief biography of Baldwin](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/1261/james-baldwin/). Here are some discussion questions:

* *Rights* has become a commonplace term. What do you think are appropriate and inappropriate uses of the word?
* What do you think of Baldwin's "intolerable bitterness of spirit"?
* What is the connection between his relationship with his father and the civil rights movements of the time (1940s and 1950s)?
* What is Baldwin's attitude toward violence?
* What do you think of his father's "legacy: nothing is ever escaped" (238)? Do you agree?
