**Spring break**: no class until Tuesday, March 9.

### Notes

I hope you have a good break. Here are a few things to be aware of for when you return:

* I hope you're ahead of the game on The Corrections: Once we start, we will move quickly, and you'll be in trouble if you fall behind.
* Remember my brief speech at the beginning of last class. We've expanded the way we discuss readings from thinking only about community to thinking also about interpretation and representation. Let's try to be aware of these issues as we go forward in our reading and writing.
* Mid-term grades will be available soon. Please e-mail me if you want to find out your grade before you return from break.
