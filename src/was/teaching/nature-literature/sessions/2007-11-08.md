### Reading

* <cite>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</cite>, fitts III--IV

### Notes

We'll try to finish SGGK today. It will be OK to turn in a response paper on fitt IV next Tuesday --- but only so long as you don't repeat what we discuss in class. There should still be plenty of room for you to explore the text!
