Regarding invasive species from last class: It turns out that goldfish are part of the "carp" family. The current environmental threat in the US, however, is with the [grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_carp), [silver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_carp), [bighead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bighead_carp), and [black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carp) carp.

Regarding the wild fire: I was thinking of the [Milford Flat fire](https://www.npr.org/2007/07/09/11826471/deadly-wildfires-blacken-western-states) that started in July 2007, due to a lightning strike in "cheat grass."
