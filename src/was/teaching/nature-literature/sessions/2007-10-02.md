I'm very sick; apologies.

### Midterm Guidance

The midterm exam is on Thursday, October 4.

If you've studied the assigned readings & schedule notes and taken your own notes in class, you can expect to do well on the midterm.

The exam will cover material from Genesis 1.1--3 through <cite>Piers Plowman</cite>, Passus VI. (You're welcome to bring Passus XVI--XX into play, if you wish, though I won't expect you to do so; we'll finish covering these passus after the mid-semester break.)

You'll need to be aware of key terms that we've discussed in class; those terms include *concatenation*, *hubris*, *nemesis*, *allegory*, & *personification*. You'll also want to pay attention to such things as the function of dreams & prophetic vision and idealization & vilification, since these concepts appear in many of the texts we've covered.

You will be asked a series of questions that will require a very brief response. In addition, you will be expected to answer one or two short essay questions; you will have some choice about which essays to write.

If you missed class and are concerned about what you missed, please talk with your classmates; they may have taken notes that they might be willing to share with you. If you have any urgent questions or concerns about the exam, please e-mail me! I'll try to get back to you no later than noon tomorrow.
