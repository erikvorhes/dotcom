### Reading

* <cite>Pearl</cite>, I--VII
* "[<cite>Pearl</cite> and Middle English](/notes/pearl-me)"

### Notes

We will begin by discussing material from yesterday. In some ways, <cite>Pearl</cite> functions as a response to the curse(s) at the end of Genesis 3, although this connection is far from apparent.

Once we get to <cite>Pearl</cite>, I'll have a few introductory things to say about the poem, its structure, etc. Then we'll attempt to parse these questions:

* What role does nature play while the poet/narrator is awake?
* How do the poet/narrator's surroundings change after he has fallen asleep?
