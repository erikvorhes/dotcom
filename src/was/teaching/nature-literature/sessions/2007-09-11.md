### Reading

* William Blake, ["The Lamb" & "The Tyger"](/notes/blake-lamb-tyger)
* Barbara Kingsolver, "The Memory Place" (199--205)
* Robert Frost, "A Brook in the City" (422--424)

### Notes

In addition to the above material, I'll talk a little more about Pearl, the transience of the moon, and the poem's conceptual relation to Blake's "London." Don't worry --- I'll be brief; we unfortunately need to move on to "new" material.

*Office hours today are cancelled; apologies.*

**The [essay requirements](/was/teaching/nature and literature/essay) are available.**
