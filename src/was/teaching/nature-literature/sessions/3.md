### Reading

* <cite>Pearl</cite>, VIII--XV

### Notes

The debate between the narrator/dreamer and the Pearl Maiden is heavy in its scriptural references. Two of the more important passages come from the gospels: [Matthew's parable of the workers in the vineyard] (https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=55657709) and the story of Jesus and the children (found in [Mark] (https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=55657765) and [Luke] (https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=55657827)).

Because the above passages in Mark & Luke tell essentially the same story, it might be fruitful to consider the differences in their accounts. What do you notice? Do these differences have any bearing in what the Pearl Maiden has to say?
