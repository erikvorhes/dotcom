### Notes

We will discuss the [essay requirements](/was/teaching/nature-literature/essay), if you have any questions!

Ellen Meloy provides a rough account of her trip. Here is [a Google Maps approximation] (https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=Cedar+City,+UT&daddr=St.+George,+UT+to:Las+Vegas,+NV&mrcr=1&mra=pi&sll=37.39349,-113.32246&sspn=1.038671,2.05719&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=8&om=1).

To get an idea of the kind of landscapes that Meloy would regularly encounter, check out the DNR sites for [Zion] (https://www.nps.gov/zion/) and [Bryce Canyon] (https://www.nps.gov/brca/) National Parks. You might also be interested in a picture of the Grand Canyon:
