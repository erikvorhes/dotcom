### Reading

* <cite>Piers the Ploughman</cite>, prologue & passus V--VI

### Notes

*Passus*{lang="la"} is Latin for 'step' (singular and plural forms are identical in appearance). In the case of <cite>Piers</cite>, think about the stages of a pilgrimage or some other holy journey. More practically, note that "passus" also functions as a stand-in for "book" (or "chapter"). So for today you need to read books 5 & 6, in addition to the prologue.

Wikipedia has a decent entry about the [Malvern Hills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvern_Hills) area, where William Langland (our author) was from.
