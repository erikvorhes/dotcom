## Learning outcomes

See [the outcomes page](../outcomes) for the official university statement of learning objectives and competencies for this course.

## Academic integrity

Plagiarism or cheating of any kind will incur severe penalties that may include a grade of F for the course. Instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Chair of the English Department and to the Dean of the student's college. For a brief explanation of what constitutes plagiarism and why it violates basic academic principles, see the section on "Academic Integrity" in the <cite>Undergraduate Studies Catalogue</cite>. Be sure also to familiarize yourself with the English department's discussion of "The Use and Misuse of Source Materials." If you have questions about academic integrity or the appropriate use of sources, please do not hesitate to speak with me.

## Class procedures

You are expected to attend every class session and actively participate in class discussion. Missing class will likely hamper your understanding of the course material. Learning is a collaborative process: while I have my own interests when it comes to the course material, it is also imperative that we pursue *your* interests and concerns. I encourage you to come to class with notes and potential discussion questions.

## Writing format

Each writing assignment is due at the beginning of the class period. All writing assignments should be typed, double-spaced, and in 12-point "Times New Roman" or another reasonably-sized (and readable) font. Writing assignments should also have one-inch margins and follow the citation standards in the <cite>MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</cite> (6th edition). Please do not use a separate title page. Electronic submissions of written work are not accepted.

## Grading

* Class participation: 10%
* Response papers: 10%
* Midterm: 15%
* Essay: 40%
* Final: 25%

Your class participation grade will be lowered 2.5 percentage points for each unexcused absence.

Late submissions will be lowered a grade each day they are late (e.g., a B+ will become a B).

Graded material will consist of response papers, a longer essay, and exams.

## Response Papers

Over the course of the semester, you have the opportunity to write four one-page response papers. Each response paper should address one of our assigned readings and focus on a passage, question, issue, or idea that you find compelling. Response papers are an opportunity for you to discover what you think about a topic; you might even find a compelling essay topic in one or more of your response papers. Be sure, therefore, to write about what interests you --- no matter how silly you might think I might find it. Each response paper is due on the first day that we discuss the text it addresses. You need to write at least two response papers before the midterm exam.

## Essay

The essay is an opportunity for you to engage one or more of the issues raised by our texts and in class. While the main thrust of the essay should be some form of literary analysis, you are welcome to employ your own interests in developing your argument. The essay must be no shorter than five pages. Additional requirements can be found on [the essay assignment page](../essay).

## Midterm exam

This closed-book exam will cover all material before the exam date and will consist primarily of short essays and the identification of terms.

The exam takes place on [Thursday, Oct. 4](../schedule#2007-10-04), 8:30 a.m. to 9:45 a.m., in the classroom.

## Final exam

The final exam will follow the format of the midterm, but it will be comprehensive in its scope and have a slightly longer essay component.

The exam takes place on [Saturday, Dec. 15](../schedule#2007-12-15), 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., in the classroom.
