Hello. I'm a software engineer with over 15 years of experience building things for the web. I believe online experiences should be accessible, readable, and usable, and that design is most beautiful when it calls attention to its content instead of itself. To those ends, in design I prioritize responsive layouts and fluid typography, and in development I emphasize progressive enrichment --- separating structure, style, and interaction --- with semantic markup, CSS-based layouts, and unobtrusive JavaScript.

I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to build things that can make people's lives better: internal tools, enterprise and educational software, informational websites, and anything in between. I live and work in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

## Under construction!

I'm migrating a bunch of old stuff into new structures, so things might be broken. If you notice anything amiss, feel free to track me down on [social media](/is/elsewhere#social-media). Have a great day!

## Typographic colophon

If your browser supports webfonts and CSS custom properties (and it should!), most of what you see is probably set in one of the [Fedra Screen](https://www.typotheque.com/search/Fedra+Screen/) fonts, from Typotheque. The icon sitting in the navigation is a superficially-modified version of the ampersand from [Megazoid](https://djr.com/notes/megazoid-font-of-the-month), by David Jonathan Ross.
