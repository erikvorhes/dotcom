Portfolio site of Erik Vorhes. Code uses the MIT license; text

The site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/), with some design system inspiration and borrowings from Andy Bell’s “[Build Excellent Websites](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/build-excellent-websites)” and the equally excellent [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/). The webfonts in use are the [Fedra Screen](https://www.typotheque.com/search/Fedra+Screen/) fonts, from Typotheque. The icon is an unmodified ampersand from [Megazoid](https://djr.com/notes/megazoid-font-of-the-month), by David Jonathan Ross.

I’ve attempted to make the site accessible to all users, but if something is amiss, please file an issue!
